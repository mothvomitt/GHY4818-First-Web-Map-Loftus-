## `if i could walk anywhere right now`
this is meant to be a project with an expectation of human limitations and just my wants, four places that i would walk in a day if my exhaustion and time weren't problems. so, we start at bavarian. i used to basically live there. i don't anymore (thank you helene). but regardless, start there. i'm a big fan of junuluska park and howard's knob- i go there probably more times a week than i'd like to count (again. thanks helene.). but then, let's move it on down to sheetz because they just opened and i have been waiting for this for years. and then the nature preserve, because i'm a bio major and i go there more times than i'd like to count. each marker has a tooltip indicating what it is on the map. :)
